# gulp-test-drive

This is a simple demo, created it as a test drive for gulp! 

**Setup:**

```
$ npm install
```

**Run:**

```
$ gulp
```

**Build:**

```
$ gulp build
```

**Notes:**

- 404 page setup should be handled in server side
- use those paths "./css/\*", "./images/\*" and "./js/\*" while you are working with your html/templates/blocks.
